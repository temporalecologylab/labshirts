This folder contains most of the tshirt files I found related to the lab. This includes:

LogoAndTshirtDesign from Google drive (now deleted from google drive) -- which is what F Jones pulled together in 2021 and goes with the gray OSPREE shirts. I re-named the folders within this to:
	logo2021/
	tshirts2021ideas/

tshirts2020/ (was just on Lizzie's computer methinks, as git/lab/tshirts) -- the current most popular shirt (and some folders on the logo)

tshirts2014/ (was just on Lizzie's computer methinks, as HU/lab/tshirt) -- most of the files transferred except one email on buying the shirts (but that company was out of business by 2020 is my recollection, anyway, relevant text is: http://www.sflashtees.com/ - Chuck and Tony are brothers/co-owners, both great guys. They are affordable and local - but also very disorganized and often late with orders. So be prepared for things to be late by a week or two. When you walk in their shop you'll see its chaos.)


I also pulled and organized: `Ordering Lab Tshirts' in Orders & Travels on google drive into this folder.
