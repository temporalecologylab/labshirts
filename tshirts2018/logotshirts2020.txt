Discussion on lab t-shirt at virtual retreat
5 November 2020

Deirdre, Geoff, Cat, Dan, Darwin, Lizzie


LOGOS
Lots of folks like 1 and 5 for the winegrape logo. They liked it so much there was interest in a version that would work for the lab as well. Using either Corylus cornuta (an east-west disjunct sp so I like that) for the leaves? (And flower/fruit ... not sure, we did not discuss). Other ideas were a Populus species that is widely distributed (to represent the widely distributed lab).

On this topic people also got excited about how to include time. Dan suggested a clock face with tree branches (not sure there was much excitement there or for the hourglass idea) ... other mentions included a melted clock, a sundial but made with a tree, a carousel of changing trees etc.

T-SHIRTS
- Discussion of t-shirt color (which impacts design color) and everyone wants a white-design that will work on different colored t-shirts. So there was interest in more options or just options that are shows as white on a colored background.
- Exciting debate -- some people really liked spring because we mainly study spring, but others thought spring looked 'dead' ... I explained my idea of the vines leafing out before the canopy tree and Dan pointed out, ”a biologically accurate t-shirt is not the goal,” which I agree with.
- People wanted 'less grape and more tree' so a smaller vine in general as best I understood. 
- General agreement summer tree was 'too lush' so maybe a more spring-like tree? "Mid-spring" was suggested. 
- Should we add an osprey (eating or carrying a fish) on the tree or flying away to represent OSPREE?
